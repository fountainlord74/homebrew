				"As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you channel negative energy through your strike to weaken the target. The first time the target makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw before the start of your next turn, it must roll a d4 and subtract the value from its roll.",
